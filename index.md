## My Reflections on Digital Wellbeing

At the beginning of 2021, I was very digitally unhealthy. My average screen time was 11+ hours per day. As I wasn’t doing anything meaningful on my phone, when the day was over, the void of knowing that I’ve wasted so many hours made me feel bad. The negativity got carried over to the next day. After a few weeks, I was in such a bad shape: unproductive, anxious, easily distracted, and lacking sleep. 

Studies show that the internet and digital device have penetrated the life of most adults. About one-quarter of adults in the US reported that they are almost always online[^1]. When the smartphone and the internet make our daily life so much easier, it can affect people in negative ways like what I have experienced. 

I want to break down what was driving my behavior, explore the scientific reasons behind it, and reflect on how I improved my relationship with my phone.

### The temptation to instant joy

My mental state played a huge part in the onset of this addiction with my smartphone. I was enduring the greatest anxiety and uncertainty about life that I’ve ever experienced so far. Stressed out by school and internship, I would go on my phone whenever I had some free time instead of getting a proper relaxation. Why? Because it is the quickest way to find something entertaining. 

Supplying instant entertainment is what exactly social media platforms and their smartphone applications are designed to do. They employ a sophisticated reinforcement method using variable rewards[^2]. You get rewards occasionally so you would keep going, hoping for the next reward to come. This was what kept me on my phone as I was always looking for that next funny video or beautiful post, assuming it would appear soon. For other people, it might be the next like or comment.

When a reward is perceived, it increases dopamine activity, which is a type of neurotransmitter responsible for the pleasure feeling, forming a positive feedback loop in our brain. Long-term enhancement of this feedback loop eventually leads to the cue (such as turning on the screen), instead of the reward itself, becoming the trigger for dopamine activation. Moreover, dopamine drops rapidly after an increase. Once you get pulled back from the satisfaction you just experienced, you will want to get more. The mechanism social media platforms use fits perfectly into this dopamine-driven feedback loop[^3].

### The habit of keeping my phone close by

I always had my phone near me. As I started to pay close attention to my interaction with it, I noticed that I would reach for my phone, turn on the screen, check it, and then put it back again and again. I wasn’t aware of how often I was doing that until then. Sometimes I would even unlock the phone, thanks to the smoothness of the fingerprint unlock, and start doing completely unnecessary things, like opening the *Settings* menu or checking my inbox. It had become a motor reflex.

It might not seem like a serious problem. Isn’t it just an a-few-minute break? Not really. It’s silently draining your cognitive energy.

Task switching incurs cognitive costs[^4]. The switching is most expensive when going from an easier task to a complex one immediately[^5]. Responses will be significantly slower after such a switch. Normally, looking at our phone is a much easier task than the real task we want to finish but gets interrupted frequently.

The notification system makes things worse.

> "I do actually open those apps frequently enough that I don't need to be reminded I need to open it every minute."
 
When a notification draws your attention, it’s eating your limited daily cognitive resource up. Whether you click on it and get distracted for a few minutes or just simply look at it for a few seconds, the intake and process of information are done. Studies show that email and other notifications increase inattention and stress[^6][^7]. This is also why browsing on your phone is not a proper relaxation of your brain. As much as you are not deliberately contemplating, using your phone is inevitably cognitive demanding because of the massive amount of information present online.

### Getting my life together

Phone detoxication was a long and gradual journey for me. 

The social media platforms and the smartphone system put so much effort into pulling you in but so little into helping you stay away when you want to. 

My first attempt was setting a screen time limit for all applications on my phone. It worked for a few days, then I got used to clicking the “15 more minutes” option.

I then uninstalled all my social media applications. This method worked better. I sometimes reinstalled them back, but the effort involved served as a reminder of how I should use them. I would delete them as soon as I sensed that I was spending too much time on them. My screen time went down to 6-8 hours per day.

Recently I improved a bit further. My average screen time is stable at 5.5 hours per day while I can name a lot of fragments that are meaningful such as group meetings, catching up with family and friends, and trip planning.

All the reasons and methods aside, “I” am the greatest factor and the best method. My mental state got better as my life was settling down. As the new semester starts, I finally have my feet on the ground. I found my goals and passion again. I've also developed a time management system that suits me. There are so many things that I want to do other than staying on my phone, so I do those instead.

Being aware of the concept of “digital wellbeing” and what's working against my detoxication is also important. I highly recommend watching the documentary-drama *The Social Dilemma*!
